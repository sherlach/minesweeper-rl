default controls [keys can be remapped but not functions]


ACTIONS (take a turn)

yuhjklbn movement/drill (vi/rogue - like)
(move into excavated squares, otherwise drill)

> -> drill down (only in soft material)


NON-ACTIONS (do not take a turn)

s -> status (prints your current health, depth.) (Killed enemies?? Time playing??) 
i -> inventory (just amount of minerals you have)
m -> map view (can't see enemies but can see uncovered squares and numbers, scrollable)


Esc -> save and quit






default map symbols [can be configured]

@ - player
# - unexcavated ground
. - exploded mine
> - soft material
1, 2, 3 etc. - Number of explosives in the near vicinity (3x3 grid)
  - excavated ground, no explosives nearby
! - enemy organic

contrived example (real map would not be this small):


+================+
"###############."
"###    >#####2##"
"### @   ##### ##"
"###1       1 !!."
