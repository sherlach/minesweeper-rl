only one enemy "type" - organic

but have different behaviour and attributes (hidden)

eg.

BEHAVIOURS:

aggressive (will follow player)
cautious (won't)
intelligent (knows where mines are)



ATTRIBUTES:

strong (hits deal 2x HP per hit)
fast (every second turn, moves 2 squares)
weakened (can't hit 2x in a row)
slow (can't move 2x in a row)
healthy (can survive a mine explosion)
stealthy (player won't detect until they are adjacent)







collecting minerals from inventory can be "crafted" to make powerups

eg.

Stealth Unit (prevents enemy noticing you as easily)
Repair Kit (temporarily refills health)
Electromesh Field (absorbs one explosion, single use)
**special** Anti-Grav Repulsor (allows you to return to the surface)

a powerup can only be used once every X turns
