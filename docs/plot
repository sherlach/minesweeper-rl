You are a WX Reaper series mining drone, [Weaper] tasked with recovering rare minerals from the desert planet Terra, designation 3 in the Sol sector. Unfortunately, what was to be a peaceful search-and-drill mission turns sour when you discover explosive material fragments embedded in the biome and crazed organics near your dropsite. 

Although you have nothing with which to defend yourself against organics, fortunately your Czytech Corp(TM) environment sensor is able to detect explosive and unstable particles with reasonable accuracy. Though you cannot pinpoint exact locations, approximate signal strength from a given square is able to be ascertained, so long as the square has been drilled into and cleared of rubble. Avoid drilling into blocks with explosive particles at all cost!

As you drill, you may encounter patches of softer material. It is possible to drill down into such material, though be warned! Without repulsors, it will be impossible to counteract gravity and return up through the hole!


Survive. Mine. And maybe, crazily, hopefully, find a way to rejoin the mothership.
